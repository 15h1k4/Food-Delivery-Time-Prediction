# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction

**Introduction:** Our aim is to create a predictive model that estimates the time taken for a delivery person to transport food from the restaurant to the designated delivery location. We'll be considering several key factors in our analysis, including the age of the delivery person, their previous ratings, and the distance between the restaurant and the delivery destination.

**Dataset Columns:**
* ID
* Delivery_person_ID
* Delivery_person_Age
* Delivery_person_Ratings
* Restaurant_latitude
* Restaurant_longitude
* Delivery_location_latitude
* Delivery_location_longitude
* Type_of_order
* Type_of_vehicle

**Models used** - Linear regression, Decision Tree, XG Boosting, Random Forest
